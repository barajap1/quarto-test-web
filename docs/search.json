However, this effect is not statistically significant (p > 0.05), so we conclude that there was not a campus-wide bias against applicants of either gender in 1973.\nThat said, individual departments often handle their own admissions processes, so it is plausible that bias exists in one department but not another.

    "text": "Bias or discrimination?\nWell then! If we take Department A in isolation, we find there is a statistically significant bias in favour of women. So does that mean that the department discriminated against men?\nNot necessarily. After all, the bias might exist simply because the female applicants to Department A were better qualified that year. In their article dealing with this issue, Bickel, Hammel & O’Connell (1975) define discrimination as “the exercise of decision influenced by the sex of the applicant when that is immaterial to the qualifications for entry”. Since we do not have any data on the respective qualifications of the candidates, we cannot say whether any gender bias in their admissions process amounted to discrimination.\nAlthough now more than 40 years old, the Berkeley problem is a useful reminder about the dangers of aggregation and omitted variable bias, especially in relation to matters of such legal and ethical importance as discrimination. Where bias does exist – as it does in the case of Department A – it is always worth considering whether there are any other factors that could explain the discrepancy.\n\n# Define bias\nbias <- \"A pattern of association between a particular decision and a particular sex of applicant, of sufficient strength to make us confident that it is unlikely to be the result of chance alon\"\n# Define discrimination\ndiscrimination <- \"The exercise of decision influenced by the sex of the applicant when that is immaterial to the qualifications for entry\"\n# Is bias equal to discrimination?\nbias == discrimination\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThis project was completed as part of Datacamp projects"
